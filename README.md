# odin-recipes
My first project from the Odin Project "Foundations" course. It is a basic website for recipes, designed to practice HTML.

I expect to my hand set on making links, and setting up multiple subpages. Plus it will be a good exercise to increase my typing speed, my comfort with the terminal as it pertains to Git, as well as HTML.
